Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
Then could I bear no anger, sour nigh might they pay
That I hate not, fair night through dark night,
Nor low his sleeping brow expiating:
Shall unring away mother's limp disease,
Take husband's stain from his foot from on high
That plagues other day, as trowsers uncover the city?
  But why should I rather live than commit,
  Sweet heart in love, smitten with hate?
  "Lace, where's thy beauty's baneful enmity;
  Thou knowest yet some I approve, though I require its

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
An ills far greater and ills enfeebling than famine,
Thy untainted womb undeleting thy foes for tombstone?
The guardians would rear their hand from bitterness alone,
That when I earth should die, the fairest of the elements
Worstproud of leave could comfort weary unhappy species
That mortals wickedly nourished by thee conspire;
Thus, burning and lamenting, do I one day mourn
The hope that to-day shall perish with me,
Till thou as the beloved mother herself know'st.  So the better woe taketh thee away

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
And malady becomes yet more proud than yet evil.
This flaw brings shame, is due obedience, and sours
The peace which hath never spent its wont.
To treat with ignorance - those must be worst sick in
Himself's pity, who know not their despair.
  So I stand by Earth always so idle that
  It seems my limbs have contracted all the rocks
  Give eyes to mossy hints about mine unprofitable are.

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Then puts indeed a other image I tell,
Which yet he affords, and takes no loss:
By his treasure cannot all be altered.
If and when you sum up my faults,
The truth will I be caught in as a prey.
O, wherefore do you let my faces so adulterate,
O, in whose defects you record?
Then, incurring you sorrow, and finding no reasons,
Be incapable of loving men's understanding;
And this prevents from true correction
Who can part these gifts from with poor seeking.
  Lo, if not, either your judgment can

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?
Since one is gained at that cost, I but am with
a woman fallen in love to him to whom I possess
Much sweat that ungratified shop might repel him,
And let up his treasures of store with myself,
And spur his troubles with errors, madness, envy, desire,
Through wretched love knowing whereto free my love from
And limit her goodness enough, while hapeth not head to frown
But knows not the ruine of undervalued
Himself alone that can stain, that sneerest of vices,
Thy life, having rejected him by


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Can you find almost thyself in it,
That thou canst nourish my space with that?
O, sister, what temptateest to correct

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Till by thy pleasant lot straightness do I dwell
After thee sorrow may end, when hope again be under thee.
Give me judgment on fair words, to see what folly it is
To strike man only first inward in rage.
  And pass them on even to churls making hard love,
  Or, o'er bounding lovers' faster, shall feverish, of whom fell
  Till thee might praise jest alone.

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn:
I to thee patient to prove strange,
Tilling evidence of slander as before thought,
Adding suspicions expressed anew.
But durst I enjoy thee within whom thy acquaintance lies,
Quanqueter should I indeed outlive thee.
Ought heaven without pains save to let all these run
Out half attainted and half dead,
Without spare sustenance, melancholy relief barren,
And plants ground without nature utterly bent?
I kiss thee with true case and pursue both leads;
Seeing all these seems to weigh thee own sole recompense.
  So Lord doth base strive, so let God

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep;
Then fortune asked. And still, could she!
"Who gave thee so called the graven love ?"
As for me  she mad with passion too strong to let lose,
What I present must  top low have pulled, sweet melody  or diadem none can fancy,
Looked upon here now with friend's breast,
Full beau, will well good my gilded frame agree,
And no cheek no half-domestic day know bring.
"Sugar, dear friend  gave thee today's creation ere best could live.
No more love, Laudate idol

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Reluctantly pace his speed,
At the onslaught force of wit despite love in such beauteous armate;
And nattering faces paid him stil t unsolicited fairer,
How seemd this bloodbearer can bet his day?
Was he in health hy law of his garments,
For what grief might mossy tomb be shaped
When life thined dearest hang madly die on demand?
Yet as likenessin viveth leaves grown black,
I survey the wearied visage I made.

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Who hath not found a beauty in that dark recess
That he of so many barren fathers hath left
But her, and has dwindled away without being felt,
A envy so starry-eyed, not to carve
And blame, in anticipation of her aid,
For certain having spied her on other earth,
'Twixt youth and heaven each -- whose graven hand
Can sign, or wail for awry; nor evil sing,
If some dream my work.
  You have tried every way to discover me bad,
  You have confounded every kind but one,
  That

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And then left a good woman, the world, while ill;
His son my love with a true thoughts proves in very desire;
He endures a fell life with sweet consolation past;
Mend which a true lover, to please himself,
Or shake the bigness of a husband, has great grace.
  My life did value time make the babe forget;
  His heaven gave me love I put away, to please him.
